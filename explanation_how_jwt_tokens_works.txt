When user logs in with email, password .. etc
Backend checks the username, password ... etc
Signs them with the secrect key and constructs  the JWT token
JWT token is send to front end
When frontend sends requests to backend.
Backend dismantles the token to 3 pieces (HEADER, PAYLOAD, SIGNATURE) then calculates
the signature again from header and payload with the secret key and then checks
the calculated signature with the signature from the token.

In our backend the function verifyAccessToken does this is decodes the payload
which has the user data and checks the signature with the calculated signature.
