In the terminal:
python3 -m http.server 8000
-In firefox, go to:
http://localhost:8000/index.html

The final index.html file will likely be at /frontend/
This is just to be able to run the game independently for testing
I will probably only use JavaScript, since it is allowed after choosing the graphics module
The Game can be put in a separate .js file so that the main html file stays clean
