In the terminal:
python3 -m http.server 8000
-In firefox, go to:
http://localhost:8000/index.html

The final index.html file will likely be at /frontend/
This is just to be able to run the game independently for testing
Final version will like have frontend/src/main.ts and frontend/src/game/pong.ts etc
