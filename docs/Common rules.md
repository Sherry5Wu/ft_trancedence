## Email Rules
```javascript
EMAIL_REGEX = /^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/;
```

- Your email should look like a standard email address.<br>
- It starts with one or more letters, numbers, or these special characters: `. _ % + -`<br>
- Then comes the @ symbol.<br>
- After the @, there should be a domain name made of letters, numbers, dots, or dashes.<br>
- Finally, the domain ends with a dot followed by at least two letters (like `.com`, `.org`, `.fi`).<br>

In short:<br>
Your email should be something like `user.name+tag@example-domain.com`.<br>

## Password Rules

```javascript
PASSWORD_REGEX = /^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]{8,72}$/;
```
- Your password Total length between 8 and 72 characters(include 8 and 72).<br>
- It needs to have at least one lowercase letter (like `a`, `b`, `c`).<br>
- It needs at least one uppercase letter (like `A`, `B`, `C`).<br>
- It requires at least one number (like `1`, `2`, `3`).<br>
- It must include at least one special character from this set: `@ $ ! % * ? &`.<br>
- The password can only contain letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and the special characters mentioned.<br>

In short:
