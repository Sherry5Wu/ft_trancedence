# What is Node.js?
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. Traditionally, JavaScript only ran in web browsers, but Node.js enables it to run outside the browser â€” perfect for building backend servers, APIs, scripts, and more. It's fast, scalable, and event-driven, which makes it a popular choice for modern web applications. <br>

# Why Node.js?
Node.js excels at handling many simultaneous connections with minimal overhead, making it perfect for:<br>
- `Real-time applications` (chats, gaming, collaboration tools)<br>
- APIs and microservices<br>
- Data streaming applications<br>
- Command-line tools<br>
- Server-side web applications<br>
Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture makes it highly efficient for I/O-heavy workloads.<br>


# What is Fastify?
Fastify is a web framework built on top of Node.js. It's like Express.js, but faster and more efficient. Fastify is designed to be:<br>
- Lightweight
- High-performance (very fast HTTP server)
- Developer-friendly
- Plugin-based, so it's easy to extend and scale.

Developers use Fastify to create REST APIs, microservices, and backend applications that are robust and easy to maintain.<br>

Example Use Case:<br>
With Node.js, you get the engine to run server-side code.<br>
With Fastify, you get a toolkit to build web APIs faster and with better structure.<br>
